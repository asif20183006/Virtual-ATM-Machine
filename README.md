# Virtual-ATM-Machine
Created an ATM in Java to illustrate ATM transactions. When the system starts the user is prompted with user id and user pin. The user must choose an option from the alternatives given on the screen in the ATM application. Withdraw money, deposit money, check your balance, and exit are the options available.

* To withdraw money, simply obtain the user’s withdrawal amount, deduct it from the total balance, and print the successful message.
* To deposit money, simply ask the user for the deposit amount, add it to the total balance, and print the successful message.
* To check the balance, simply publish the user’s total balance.
* To exit the current Transaction mode and return the user to the initial screen, use the exit() option.
